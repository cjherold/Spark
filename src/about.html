					I wanted to try using Vite, and I ended up creating this front-end starter. I enjoyed using it so much that I rebuilt my entire personal site with it. Eventually, I might also add a back-end aspect to it using express. The theme of this project is simple, light, flexible, and fast. Anything that I might add in the future must not break this theme. I hope that the 2 example pages show how this starter can be used without adding too much junk. Feel free to remove some of the dependencies from the package.json once you get started. Mostly, just have fun!
